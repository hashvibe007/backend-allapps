The document is a Liver Function Test report presenting results for various parameters including Bilirubin (Total, Indirect, Conjugated, Delta), Total Protein, Albumin, Globulin, A/G Ratio, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), Gamma GT (GGT), and Alkaline Phosphatase. Results are provided for three dates: December 22, 2022, March 01, 2023, and March 31, 2023. The table includes the test name, the measured value for each date, an interpretation ("Your Value" - Normal or High), and the reference range. Several tests show values outside the normal range, specifically SGOT (AST), Gamma GT (GGT), and Alkaline Phosphatase are consistently marked as "High" across the dates shown. SGPT (ALT) is marked as "Normal" on the latest date (Mar 31, 2023) but was "High" on Mar 01, 2023. The methods used for some tests are also mentioned, such as Azobilirubin/dyphylline for Bilirubin Total and methods involving Pyridoxal 5 Phosphate for SGOT and SGPT.
